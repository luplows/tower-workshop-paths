# Steward bootstrap checklist

The hand-run procedure for "The move, in order", step 2, in
[`agent-workflow-design.md`](agent-workflow-design.md), "Portability": creating `luplows/steward`
from this repository. It is run by the owner with Session A. It is not a story, and nothing
dispatches from it.

**Status: agreed by the owner on 2026-10-08, with the six decisions in section 9 (D-1 to D-6; D-7
to D-9 were added the same day, D-10 to D-12 on 2026-10-09, and D-13 on 2026-10-10).** Nothing
below has been run except the two dry runs in section 3. It runs once P1 to P6 hold. The
decisions themselves live in the design doc's Portability section; this file is the procedure,
and where it restates a decision it names the one it must not drift from.

**Paused 2026-10-09 by the owner**, during the real extraction, before A1: steward is to be defined
first (design doc, "Portability", "Decided so far"). What the extraction ran and found is in
section 3.

Every count and line number here was re-derived on `main` at `09147c3` for the fresh dry run
(section 3), unless it names another commit, and **is checked again at the real extraction**: the
pull request that records the fresh dry run moves `main` itself.

## 1. Before starting

- [ ] **P1.** OQ-116, OQ-117, OQ-118, OQ-121, OQ-122 to OQ-131, OQ-135 and OQ-136 are in
      `stories/done/` on `main`. Of those, the move needs OQ-118, OQ-117, OQ-122 to OQ-131 (design
      doc, "The move, in order", step 1), and the `fix` stories OQ-135 and OQ-136, written since.
      OQ-116 and OQ-121 were ahead of them in the queue, and were built on 2026-10-08.
- [ ] **P2.** No open pull request changes a moving path.
- [ ] **P3.** `git ls-remote --heads origin` shows no `story/` branch for a moving story.
- [ ] **P4.** The loop is not running, and the dispatcher session has nothing in flight, so `main`
      does not move during the extraction. Record the `main` SHA extracted from.
- [ ] **P5.** `git filter-repo --version` runs. It is installed with `pip install --user`, in the
      Python user `Scripts` directory, which is not on `PATH`.
- [ ] **P6.** `gh repo view luplows/steward` still reports no such repository.

## 2. What is extracted

The design doc's R1 table, with the gaps the dry run found. Re-derive the moving stories with the
rule in R4: every unbuilt `kind: workflow` story, except OQ-72, OQ-94, OQ-115, OQ-117, OQ-118,
OQ-137, OQ-115's clean-up stories OQ-132 to OQ-134, and, since 2026-10-10, OQ-46, OQ-100 and
OQ-105 (D-13). This repository keeps its own copies of the story tooling among the paths below
(D-13).

**Paths (29, with `steward.config.json`, this checklist and OQ-129's test):**

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `scripts/dispatch/`, `scripts/land/`, `scripts/report/`, `scripts/lint-stories.mjs`, `scripts/lint-stories.test.mjs` | R1 |
| `.claude/prompts/` | R1 |
| `REVIEW.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | R1 (trimmed in section 4) |
| `docs/agent-workflow-design.md`, `docs/harness-outline.md`, `docs/session-a.md`, `docs/migration-plan.md`, `docs/gap-analysis.md` | R1 |
| `stories/README.md`, `stories/_TEMPLATE.md` | R1 |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `review-gate.yml`, `land-approved.yml` | R1 (`ci.yml` is rewritten in section 4) |
| `steward.config.json` | Added by OQ-122 (rewritten in section 4) |
| `test/fixtures/` | Not in R1: `lint-stories.test.mjs` reads two files there |
| `stories/done/OQ-51-story-injection-boundary.md`, `OQ-68-github-operations.md`, `OQ-69-reviewer-dispatch.md`, `OQ-70-coder-dispatch.md` | Not in R1: tests read them as fixtures (`queue.test.mjs`, `render.test.mjs`, `lint-stories.test.mjs`) |
| `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.oxlintrc.json`, `.gitignore` | Not in R1: steward's lint, PRs and ignores |
| `docs/steward-bootstrap.md` | Added to R1 on 2026-10-08 (D-9): the record of how steward was made |
| `scripts/no-project-literals.test.mjs` | Added to R1 on 2026-10-09 (D-11): OQ-129's test, which reads only moved files |

**The 17 moving stories**, re-derived with the rule above on 2026-10-10, on #248's branch
with OQ-66 retired: OQ-54, 59, 62, 64, 71, 73, 88, 89, 98, 99, 101, 102, 103, 108, 114, 119 and
120. Each is extracted at its path under `stories/`, so its history moves with it. (Until
2026-10-10 there were 21: these, and OQ-46, OQ-66, OQ-100 and OQ-105.)

**Commit messages** (R1, "Commit messages name this repository's pull requests in plain text";
must not drift from it). The rule file, written with a heredoc, not `printf`, which mangles `\1`:

```text
literal:#122/#123==>#122 and #123
regex:\(#([0-9]+)\)==>(tower-workshop-paths PR \1)
regex:(?m)(^|[^A-Za-z0-9/&])#([0-9]+)==>\1tower-workshop-paths PR \2
```

The fresh dry run lists every `#N` these rules rewrite, and checks each against this
repository's pull requests with `gh api`. If any is not one, the bootstrap stops until the rule
leaves it alone (D-7). At `d86080c` every one was; `44b8afa` and `9f4ffb7` cite an upstream
`#1614`, and are left out only because their paths do not move. At `09147c3` every one of the
167 was too. The first, literal rule is D-10: #124's commit says `#122/#123` twice, and the
third rule leaves a `#N` after a `/` alone. The check cannot see a `#N` left alone, so the fresh
dry run also lists those: at `09147c3`, only `action#1614`, in #97's commit, an upstream issue.

**Not extracted, though a moved test reads them:** `.github/workflows/update-screenshots.yml`,
`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, `package-lock.json` and `vite.config.js`, read by OQ-117's,
OQ-124's and OQ-136's tests (B7a). Only tests of files that move go to steward, so those tests are
removed from steward's copy (D-8).

## 3. The dry runs

### The first (done 2026-10-08)

On a fresh clone of `main` at `d86080c`, in Session A's scratch folder, with the paths above
less `steward.config.json`, which did not exist yet (26 paths and the 21 stories, 47 in all), and
both rules. Nothing was pushed.

- `git filter-repo` ran in about a second, and its own fresh-clone check passed.
- 127 of 216 commits kept, and 94 files, every one on the list.
- Per-file commit counts matched the original for the 9 files checked, including this repository's
  design doc, `CLAUDE.md`, `REVIEW.md`, `coder.md`, `coder.mjs` and two moving stories. The
  history starts at this repository's first commit (2026-09-10).
- Commit subjects ending `(#N)`: 124 of 127 rewritten. Bare `#N` in bodies: 106 lines before the
  second rule, 0 after. Every one was this repository's pull request.
- **The clone's other branches become local branches** (for example `story/OQ-118-…`). Only `main`
  is pushed (section 6).

### The fresh one (done 2026-10-09)

On fresh clones of `main` at `09147c3`, in Session A's scratch folder, with the 28 paths then on
the list and the 21 stories (49 in all). Nothing was pushed. One clone took the paths alone, to
list the `#N`s in the original messages; one took the paths and the two regex rules; a third, the
paths and all three rules, after D-10.

- `git filter-repo` ran in about a second. 157 of 249 commits kept, and 101 files, every one on
  the list, and every path on the list matched a file.
- Per-file commit counts matched the original for **all 101 files**. The history starts at this
  repository's first commit (2026-09-10). The clones had no branch but `main`.
- Commit subjects ending `(#N)`: 154 of 157 rewritten. The other three are the initial commit,
  the scaffold and the merge of #1, whose subject the bare-`#N` rule rewrites. Message lines
  with a bare `#N`: 129 after the `(#N)` rule, 0 after the bare-`#N` rule.
- D-7: 167 distinct numbers rewritten, each checked against the list of this repository's pull
  requests from `gh api` (246, numbered 1 to 246): every one is one.
- Left alone: `action#1614`, and the two `#123`s of `#122/#123` (D-10). With the literal rule,
  only `action#1614`.
- `git filter-repo` also rewrites a short commit hash cited in a message, such as "on `main` at
  `5eb868f`", to that commit's hash in the new history.
- `scripts/no-project-literals.test.mjs` was found off the list (D-11).

### The real extraction (stopped 2026-10-09)

From `main` at `b2a02bf`, P1 to P6 checked and P4 confirmed by the dispatcher session, into
`E:\Source\steward-extract`. Nothing was pushed, and `luplows/steward` was not created. The
extract is kept on the owner's machine as a record.

- `git filter-repo`, with the 29 paths, the 21 stories and the three rules: 158 of 250 commits kept,
  and 102 files, every one on the list. Per-file commit counts matched for all 102. D-7: 168
  distinct numbers rewritten (the extra one is #247), every one this repository's pull request.
- B1 to B14 were committed in the extract, with one commit not in this checklist: a `.gitattributes`
  holding `* text=auto eol=lf`, since without it a checkout on a machine with `core.autocrlf=true`
  gets CRLF files.
- B15: `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, the story lint and the queue passed; the queue listed only the 21
  `ST-` stories, ST-8 and ST-18 `blocked` as B1 sets them. **`npm test`: 38 of 751 tests failed, in
  5 of 25 files.**
  - `scripts/dispatch/story.test.mjs` (33): its harness calls `runStory` without a `repoDir`, so it
    reads the settings of the directory it runs in, and rejects its story id `OQ-9` (line 29) once
    that project's prefix is `ST`.
  - `scripts/dispatch/settings.test.mjs`, `scripts/dispatch/loop.test.mjs` and
    `scripts/report/review-verdicts.test.mjs` (one each): they read the committed
    `steward.config.json` and expect this repository's values.
  - `scripts/dispatch/invocation.test.mjs` (2): they read `.claude/settings.json` (line 229), which
    does not move. B7a's rule already covered them, and the re-derivation missed them.
- What the engine itself assumes about a project, found while looking at those failures:
  - its CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is CI, and a setup step is named with `Setup: `
    (`scripts/dispatch/ci.mjs`, lines 26 and 31), which OQ-118's tests check in a real `ci.yml`;
  - its screenshots: `SCREENSHOT_DIR = 'e2e/__screenshots__/'` (`coder.mjs`, line 128);
  - its name: the dispatch commits as `dispatch@tower-workshop-paths.invalid` (`coder.mjs`, line
    385);
  - its rule files: `coder.md` reads `CLAUDE.md` and `REVIEW.md` from the project (line 140), and
    `reviewer.md` reads `REVIEW.md` and assumes `npm test`.

## 4. The bootstrap commits

On top of the extracted history, in a fresh clone at `E:\Source\steward-extract`, never a working
checkout. Each is its own commit, so the direct push in section 6 is reviewable commit by commit.

- [ ] **B1. Renumber the stories.** `git mv` each moving story to `ST-<n>`, numbered in ascending
      order of OQ id (R4, R9), and set its `id:`. Add a line to its Context: "Formerly
      tower-workshop-paths OQ-<n>." References to OQ stories that stay here keep their numbers.
      The mapping, revised on 2026-10-10 for the 17 stories (D-13). "Held" means a `blocked:`
      saying the story is held until steward's coder works, replacing any it has here:

      | ST | OQ | `depends_on` in steward | `blocked:` in steward |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | ST-1 | OQ-54 | `[]` (OQ-61 is built here) | held (D-13) |
      | ST-2 | OQ-59 | `[]` (OQ-49 is built here) | held (D-13) |
      | ST-3 | OQ-62 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-4 | OQ-64 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-5 | OQ-71 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-6 | OQ-73 | `[]` | kept, less "held until the move": see decision D-4 |
      | ST-7 | OQ-88 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-8 | OQ-89 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-9 | OQ-98 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-10 | OQ-99 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-11 | OQ-101 | `[ST-6]` (the other nine are built here) | held (D-13) |
      | ST-12 | OQ-102 | `[ST-11]` (OQ-83 and OQ-86 are built here) | held (D-13) |
      | ST-13 | OQ-103 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-14 | OQ-108 | `[]` (OQ-107 is built here) | kept: parked by the owner |
      | ST-15 | OQ-114 | `[]` (R4: `OQ-115` dropped) | held (D-13) |
      | ST-16 | OQ-119 | `[]` | held (D-13) |
      | ST-17 | OQ-120 | `[]` | held (D-13) |

      A dropped dependency is recorded in that story's Context, naming the built OQ story.
- [ ] **B2. Move the fixtures.** `git mv` the four built stories to `test/fixtures/stories/`, and
      point the tests that read them there.
- [ ] **B3. `steward.config.json`:** `{ "repo": "luplows/steward", "storyPrefix": "ST" }`.
- [ ] **B4. `package.json`.** Name `steward`, `"type": "module"`, `"private": true`, and a `bin`
      entry `steward` pointing at `scripts/dispatch/cli.mjs` (OQ-131), which already starts with
      a `#!/usr/bin/env node` line. Scripts `lint` (`oxlint`) and `test` (`vitest run`).
      `devDependencies`: `vitest` and `oxlint` only, at this repository's ranges (`^5.0.0` and
      `^1.79.0` at `09147c3`). `package-lock.json` from `npm install`.
- [ ] **B5. A Vitest config** with `environment: 'node'` and no setup file. Seven of the moved test
      files have no `@vitest-environment node` line and rely on this repository's jsdom default
      and `src/test/setup.js`, neither of which moves: `coder-env`, `outcome` and `settings` in
      `scripts/dispatch/`, and the four in `scripts/land/` (at `09147c3`).
- [ ] **B6. `ci.yml`, rewritten.** One job named `test`, so it matches the required check: checkout
      with `fetch-depth: 0`, Node 22, `npm ci`, lint, Vitest, and the story containment step. No
      build and no Playwright. Its setup steps keep the `Setup: ` name prefix, because
      `ci.test.mjs` ("OQ-118/AC-3") reads steward's own `ci.yml` and fails otherwise. OQ-117's time
      limits are kept. OQ-124's `workflow_run` trigger on `Land approved PRs`, and its job
      condition, are kept, so steward's `main` is checked after each landing (design doc,
      "Portability", "Decided so far"). OQ-124/AC-1's test, which moves, matches the `on:` block
      exactly: `pull_request` then `push`, each with `branches: [main]`.
- [ ] **B7. `review-gate.yml` and `land-approved.yml`, unchanged.** Neither names this repository:
      they take `github.repository`, and run `node scripts/land/…` without `npm ci`.
- [ ] **B7a. Tests of files that stay here, removed from steward's copy** (D-8). Re-derive them at
      the run: every test in a moved test file that reads a file not on the list in section 2.
      Known at `09147c3`, with the constants and helpers only they use:
      - in `scripts/dispatch/ci.test.mjs`, OQ-117's tests (AC-1 to AC-4), OQ-136's (AC-1 to
        AC-4, which read the Playwright install step and `vite.config.js`), and OQ-124's cases of
        `deploy-pages.yml` (AC-2, AC-3's second case, and AC-4's `deploy-pages.yml` case);
      - all of `scripts/dispatch/install-cleanup.alone.test.mjs` (OQ-136), which reads the
        Playwright install step of `ci.yml` and `update-screenshots.yml`.

      OQ-118's tests, and OQ-124's cases of `ci.yml`, are kept in steward's copy. This repository
      keeps all of its own.
- [ ] **B8. The prompts, stripped by hand** (R1, "steward starts clean"): in `coder.md` this
      repository's name, Vitest and Playwright, the screenshot-baseline rules, `mytower.app`, and
      the pointer to `Completed-Questions.md`; in `reviewer.md` this repository's name. The name
      becomes `luplows/steward`.
- [ ] **B9. `REVIEW.md`**: items 8 and 10 removed, leaving the gaps (R1).
- [ ] **B10. `CLAUDE.md`**: the workflow rules stay. This repository's "Testing" rules (Playwright,
      screenshot baselines, the buy-order algorithm) go, and the documents table loses the files
      that stay here. See D-2.
- [ ] **B11. The design doc and the other moved documents.**
      - One note at the top of each: an `OQ-<n>` means a tower-workshop-paths story, found in its
        `stories/done/` or `Completed-Questions.md`.
      - Its **Planned** markers that name a moved story take that story's `ST-<n>`. At `09147c3`
        those are OQ-73 (3), OQ-101 (2), OQ-102, OQ-108, OQ-114 and OQ-119, the same at #248's
        head on 2026-10-10. The markers naming OQ-115 (with OQ-132 to OQ-134), OQ-137 and, since
        2026-10-10, OQ-105 are reworded without a marker, since that work is this repository's
        (D-12, D-13).
      - This repository's passages, listed in R1 under "This document", and the example story:
        removed or replaced (D-1).
- [ ] **B12. Links to files that stay here**, made into plain text or links to this repository.
      Five at `09147c3`, as at `d86080c`: `CLAUDE.md` lines 62 and 90, `stories/README.md`
      lines 14 and 18, and ST-5's (OQ-71's) line 69.
- [ ] **B13. `.github/pull_request_template.md`**: its Docs check names `README.md`,
      `Open-Questions.md` and `Project-Outline.md`, which steward does not have.
- [ ] **B14. A short `README.md`**: what steward is, with a pointer to `docs/harness-outline.md`.
- [ ] **B15. Local checks**, with their real output kept for the record: `npm ci`, `npm run lint`,
      `npm test`, `node scripts/dispatch/cli.mjs lint`, and `node scripts/dispatch/cli.mjs queue`.
      The queue should list only `ST-` stories, with the statuses in B1.

## 5. Create the repository

- [ ] **A1. The owner authorises creating `luplows/steward`, public**, with no initial commit.
- [ ] Settings, mirroring this repository's as read on 2026-10-08: squash, merge-commit and rebase
      merging allowed (the sweep squashes); issues on; default workflow permissions `read`;
      Actions may not approve pull requests.
- [ ] Labels: `review-blocked` and `loop-stuck`, which this repository has. `breaker-override` is
      read by `land-approved.yml` but this repository has no such label either.

## 6. The one direct push

- [ ] **A2. The owner authorises the push explicitly, at that moment.** It is made before any
      protection exists (design doc, "The move, in order", step 2).
- [ ] Push `main` only: `git push origin main`. No other branch, no tags.
- [ ] The `ci.yml` run triggered by the push is green.

## 7. Protect `main`

- [ ] Mirror this repository's protection, as read on 2026-10-08: required checks `test` and
      `review/agent`, not strict; `enforce_admins: true`; pull requests required, with 0
      approvals; no force pushes, no deletions.
- [ ] Read the protection back with `gh api repos/luplows/steward/branches/main/protection` and
      check each setting.

## 8. Steward's own loop, and the first pull request

- [ ] A checkout of steward at `E:\Source\steward`, and the loop's own worktree made from it with
      `node scripts/dispatch/cli.mjs loop --init <path>`. `TW_MACHINE_LABEL` exported.
- [ ] Steward's own first stories written at tier `next`, on `write-story/` branches in steward,
      before its loop first runs (D-5). The design doc's "What adopting steward needs from it"
      lists what this repository's adoption (OQ-115) needs from them. Revised 2026-10-10 by the
      owner: steward starts with the gate only, and its first stories get its coder working (design
      doc, "Decided so far").
- [ ] A first, small pull request on steward (for example, its first story), reviewed and landed
      through steward's own gate, which shows `test`, `review/agent` and the sweep working.
- [ ] Record the outcome: in steward's design doc, through a steward pull request; and here, in R4,
      the OQ-to-ST mapping, through a `write-story/` pull request, in which Session A also
      retires the moved stories here, each naming its `ST-<n>` (OQ-115's Out of scope).

## 9. Decisions

D-1 to D-9 were made by the owner on 2026-10-08, D-10 to D-12 on 2026-10-09, after the fresh dry
run, and D-13 on 2026-10-10, while defining steward. All are recorded in the design doc's
Portability section (R1 and R4) and its "Decided so far".

- **D-1. This repository's passages in steward's copy of the design doc** (Pages as the alpha
  channel, the buy-order examples, scraped-data validation, the production target, `mytower.app`,
  and the example story): **stripped at the bootstrap**, as the prompts are (B11).
- **D-2. `CLAUDE.md`'s "Testing" section in steward:** **keeps** the rules that hold for steward
  (CI is required, tests alongside new logic in Vitest, no coverage tooling, green CI is not
  sufficient) and **drops** Playwright, screenshot baselines and the buy-order algorithm (B10).
- **D-3. The additions to R1's list in section 2** (`test/fixtures/`, the four fixture stories, the
  PR template, `.oxlintrc.json`, `.gitignore`): **added** to R1's table.
- **D-4. ST-6 (OQ-73; ST-8 until 2026-10-10):** **its `blocked:` is kept** in steward, less
  "held until the move": it is a spike the owner runs with Session A, not dispatched (revised
  2026-10-09 by the owner, when OQ-73 was rewritten here as that spike; design doc, R5).
- **D-5. The order of steward's first stories:** steward's own first stories (the prompts'
  `{{REPO}}` slot and project section, closing `REVIEW.md`'s gaps, and `init` with the thin
  workflow files) are **written at tier `next` before its loop first runs**, so they come before
  the moved stories. Writing them is Session A's, in steward (section 8). **Revised 2026-10-10 by
  the owner:** steward starts with the gate only, and the stories that get its coder working come
  first, ahead of these (design doc, "Decided so far").
- **D-6. The checkouts:** `E:\Source\steward-extract` for the extraction, and `E:\Source\steward`
  with the loop's worktree beside it.
- **D-7. A `#N` that is not this repository's pull request** (from the reviewer's observation on
  #215): the fresh dry run checks every rewritten `#N`, and the bootstrap stops on one that is
  not (section 2).
- **D-8. Tests** (from the reviewer's observation on #217, widened by the owner the same day):
  **only tests of files that move go to steward.** A test of this repository's own flows stays
  here, such as OQ-117's, which read this repository's Playwright steps,
  `update-screenshots.yml` and `package-lock.json`. OQ-118's move (B7a).
- **D-9. This checklist** (owner, 2026-10-08, refining OQ-115): **moves to steward** with its
  history, as the record of how steward was made. Its later steps are recorded in steward's copy,
  and OQ-134 removes it here.
- **D-10. `#122/#123`** (owner, 2026-10-09, after the fresh dry run): **a literal first rule**
  rewrites it as `#122 and #123`, so that the other two rules rewrite both numbers (section 2).
- **D-11. `scripts/no-project-literals.test.mjs`** (owner, 2026-10-09, after the fresh dry run):
  OQ-129's test, which reads only moved files, **is extracted**, and added to R1's table. OQ-132's
  open questions note that it is removed here.
- **D-12. OQ-137's Planned marker** (owner, 2026-10-09, after the fresh dry run): in steward's copy
  of the design doc it **is reworded without a marker**, as OQ-115's is (B11). The passage it is
  in, under "What CI runs", stays.
- **D-13. Which stories move, and how they are held** (owner, 2026-10-10, while defining steward;
  design doc, "Portability", "Decided so far"): **17 stories move** (section 2). OQ-46, OQ-100
  and OQ-105 stay here, and OQ-66 is retired. Every moved story **is held** in steward until its
  coder works, so nothing is ready there on its first day (B1). All 29 paths move, and this
  repository keeps its own story tooling in full (`scripts/lint-stories.mjs` and its test,
  `scripts/dispatch/story-containment.mjs`, `stories/README.md` and `stories/_TEMPLATE.md`).
