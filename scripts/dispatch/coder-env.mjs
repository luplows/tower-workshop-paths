 * The coder's capability contract (OQ-63): what a coder invocation is
 * allowed to touch, and what its process environment carries.
 *
 * The coder's *credential* is narrowed rather than its command surface:
 * `coderEnv` strips anything that would let `gh`, a `curl` invocation, or any
 * other process reach GitHub's write API (commit statuses, workflow dispatch,
 * pull request writes). That is what makes the guarantee survive `node -e`,
 * `npm`, and `npx` reaching past the Bash tool's allowlist entirely (AC-4) --
 * it has nothing to do with which command was used, only with whether a usable
 * credential exists in the environment that command inherits. Git's own
 * authentication (SSH key / credential helper) is left in place here; the
 * coder no longer needs it, and removing it is OQ-73's.
 *
 * `coderAllowedTools` is the separate, complementary layer. The coder commits
 * and the dispatcher pushes (OQ-84, `pushBranch` in `coder.mjs`), so no `git
 * push` pattern is granted and `CODER_DISALLOWED_TOOLS` denies it outright.

/**
 * The shell utilities a coder uses to inspect the repository (OQ-67 AC-4).
 * Defined here rather than by each caller, because every hand-run of the loop
 * invented its own set.
 *
 * Every entry must be unable to write in *any* mode, not merely in the way it
 * is usually called (AC-5). That rules out utilities that are read-only by
 * habit: `sed` (`-i`, and its `w` command), `sort` (`-o`), `uniq` (a second
 * operand is an output file), `find` (`-delete`, `-exec`), `awk`, `tee`,
 * `xargs` (runs its operands), `dd` (`of=`), and any interpreter (`perl`).
 * The test asserts the property by probing each entry with write-shaped
 * arguments rather than by comparing the list to a fixed one. Those probes
 * are themselves a fixed set, so a new entry is only as safe as the probes
 * are complete: check its write modes against them when adding it.
 *
 * Shell redirection (`cat f > g`) is out of this list's reach: it is a
 * property of the shell, not of the utility, and applies equally to
 * `git log > g`. The coder holds `Write` anyway; the point of "read-only"
 * here is that the list does what its name says.
