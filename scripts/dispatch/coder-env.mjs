/**
 * The coder's capability contract (OQ-63): what a coder invocation is
 * allowed to touch, and what its process environment carries.
 *
 * A coder must push its own branch, so it cannot simply be handed no GitHub
 * access the way the reviewer is (OQ-62). Instead its *credential* is
 * narrowed rather than its command surface: `coderEnv` strips anything that
 * would let `gh`, a `curl` invocation, or any other process reach GitHub's
 * write API (commit statuses, workflow dispatch, pull request writes), while
 * leaving git's own push authentication (SSH key / credential helper)
 * untouched. That is what makes the guarantee survive `node -e`, `npm`, and
 * `npx` reaching past the Bash tool's allowlist entirely (AC-4) -- it has
 * nothing to do with which command was used, only with whether a usable
 * credential exists in the environment that command inherits.
 *
 * `coderAllowedTools` is the separate, complementary layer: it scopes `git
 * push` to the one branch a given invocation was spawned for, which is a
 * property `coderEnv` alone can't provide (a credential valid for the repo is
 * valid for any branch in it).
