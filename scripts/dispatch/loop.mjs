/**
 * Runs the story queue unattended, one story at a time, from the latest
 * `origin/main` (OQ-86). It picks a story itself (AC-4), updates its own
 * checkout to `origin/main` before dispatching it (AC-1, now OQ-109's
 * `updateCheckout`), and runs it as its own child process of `story.mjs`
 * (AC-2), so every story loads the dispatch modules and prompts as they are
 * on `origin/main` at that moment.
 *
 * It reimplements none of `story.mjs`: the child process is OQ-48's entry
 * point, started fresh for each story. This module only chooses which story,
 * keeps its own checkout current between stories, and decides whether a
 * story's result lets the loop continue (AC-3).
 *
 * Nothing here spans stories beyond the checkout itself, which AC-1 updates
 * only between stories: whether a story is `in-progress` is derived fresh
 * from its branch on every pick (AC-4), never stored, so running several
 * stories at once later changes only how many are started.
 *
 * The loop runs from a worktree of its own (OQ-109), created once by `--init`
 * and never a branch checkout: `main` refuses to run from a checkout that has
 * a branch checked out (AC-2), and `updateCheckout` stops rather than discards
 * anything uncommitted it finds there between stories (AC-3).
 *
 * OQ-112: a story the loop cannot progress is raised with the owner as a
 * GitHub issue, one per story (`reportStuck`), and two or more open
 * `loop-stuck` issues stop the queue completely (`stuckLimitStatus`), on the
 * reasoning that one stuck story can be its own fault while two suggest the
 * loop's. Both are gated on `ctx` being supplied: `main` always supplies one,
 * so production runs always get them; a caller (or test) exercising only the
 * pre-OQ-112 control flow, with no `ctx`, gets exactly that flow unchanged.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/dispatch/loop.mjs --init [path]
 *   node scripts/dispatch/loop.mjs [--repo owner/name] [--max-stories N]
