// Deletes the head branch of every merged PR whose branch is still on origin.
//
// `land-approved.yml` used to rely on the repository's `delete_branch_on_merge`
// setting, which is enabled and observably does not fire (OQ-52). This makes the
// deletion an explicit act of the sweep. It is cleanup, not a gate: nothing here
// throws, so a branch that is already gone or cannot be deleted never fails the
// landing run (AC-2).
//
// A branch is deleted only if it is a same-repository head, is not the base
// branch, and still points at the exact commit the merged PR had as its head.
// A branch that has moved since -- for instance a spawn reusing the name of a
// merged story branch -- is someone's live work and is left alone.
